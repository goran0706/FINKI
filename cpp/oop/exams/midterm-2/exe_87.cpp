// You are given a class Person that stores info for name and surname (char array) and year of birth (integer).
//
// You are given a class Song that stores info for: name of the song (char array), performers of the song (array of max 10 objects of class Person), number of performers, and ratings of the song (dynamically allocated array of integers) and count of people that gave ratings. A rating is a number from 1 to 10.
//
// You are also given a class Movie that has info for name of the movie (dynamically allocated array of characters) and popularity of the movie (integer from 1 to 10).
//
// Create a class MovieSong that represents a song that is a soundtrack of a movie (class that is derived from the classes Song and Movie) so the objects from this class contain info for the name of the song, performers of the song, number of performers, grades from people, number of grades, name of the movie, popularity of the movie and popularity of the song (integer from 1 to 10). (5 points)
//
// Each song should enable the following methods:
//
//     float getTotalRating() - that returns the total rating of the song. For each song that is not a movie song, the rating is an average of the minimum and maximum rating given from people. The rating of a movie song is computed as a product of the average of minimum and maximum rating given from people and a coefficient of popularity (computed by dividing the popularity of the song with the popularity of the movie). In a case when a song does not have any ratings an exception from the class RatingMissingException should be thrown (15 points).
//         print() - that prints the name of the song and the performers of the song, and if the song is a movie song, in new line prints the name of the movie. (10 points).
//
// The format of printing a movie song is:
//
// [Performer 1] ([Year1]), [Performer2] ([Year2]) …  : [Name]
//
// Movie: [Name of the movie]
//
// Implement the following global functions:
//
//     double averageRating(Song** songs, int n) that returns the average rating of all movie songs from the list of n songs. For the songs without any ratings from people, the default rating is assumed to be 5. (15 points)
//
//     void printSongs(char* performer, Song** songs, int n) - that for a given array of songs, will print only those performed by the performer passed as an argument. (10 points)
//
// Fully functionality of the program. (5 points)
//
// You are allowed to add additional methods to the provided classes Person, Song and Movie.
//
// For example:
// Input 	Result
//
// 1
// Glory 2 J.Legend 1978 Common 1972 2 4 10 Selma 30 5
//
//
//
// -----TEST MovieSong-----
